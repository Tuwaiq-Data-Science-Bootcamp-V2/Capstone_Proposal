# Capstone Proposal

### Project Title: Skin Disease Classification (DermAi)


#### Group Members:
- Ali Almuhaysin
- Khalid Alsumali
- Mohammed Alshaekh

#### Objectives:
A Deep-learning Model to classify Skin Diseases based on an input pic from the user for part of the skin. Finally, gives some info about the classified type of disease from trusted health websites or Wikipedia, gives some advice, and encourages users to visit a dermatologist.

#### Dataset Description:
- The number of Pictures: +20k.

#### Dataset Link:
- [ISIC (The International Skin Imaging Collaboration)]('https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main')
- [Dermnet (Kaggle)]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubhamgoel27/dermnet')
- [Skin Cancer MNIST: HAM10000 (Kaggle)]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000')
- [Skin diseases image dataset (Kaggle)]('https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ismailpromus/skin-diseases-image-dataset')

#### The expected Deep Learning Algorithms:
**The Project** will employ `CNN architecture` for deep learning. A custom CNN arch. will be made or an existing one *that suits the project's data and target*.
