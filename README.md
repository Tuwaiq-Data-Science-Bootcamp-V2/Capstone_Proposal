# Capstone Proposal


### Please edit this README.md file based on your Capstone project idea.

# Project 1 Title:
Detecting wanted people in public places using computer vision.

#### Group Members:
- Razan Alyahya
- Rahaf Aladhyani
- Munirah Alsahly
- Waleed Almutairi

#### Objectives:
With the development of technology and the entry of artificial intelligence into our lives, we decided to build a project that helps the Competent Authorities to find the wanted people quickly and easily. The process of idintrying wanted people noww take a long time and effort to increase Security and Saftey in Saudi Arabia.


#### Dataset Description:
- Number of images in dataset is 200K images.

#### Dataset Link:
The project dataset is from [Kaagle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashishjangra27/gender-recognition-200k-images-celeba), which contains different faces.....


#### The expected (Machine learning / Deep Learning) Algorithms:
Deep Learning


# Project 2 Title:
Real-Time, Deep Learning Based Wrong Direction Detection.


#### Objectives:
In Hajj and Umrah, we sometimes go through periods of congestion, and the causes of congestion are many. One of the most common reasons is that the pilgrims do not adhere to walking in the correct direction, because there are people walking opposite the direction that causes congestion. In this project, we contribute to reducing congestion by informing the competent authorities about that.
