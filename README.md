Group Members:
Lama Mugren (Team Leader)
Manar Alabdulkarim

Objective:
The main goal of this project is to create a service that can predict the length and number of court sessions for people who want to file a court case. It also, gives the correspondant costs of the case filing from the guide provided by the ministry of justice and the suggests licensed attorneys in the user's city.  


The objectives are:

To offer a platform where people can predict how long it would take for a judgement before filing their court case
To use artificial intelligence to predict the length and number of court sessions
To provide the corresponding costs for filing the case based on the guide provided by the Ministry of Justice
To give suggestions for licensed attorneys in the user's city
