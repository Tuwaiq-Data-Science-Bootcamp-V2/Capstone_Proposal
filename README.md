# Capstone Proposal

#### Project Title:
Who is the reciter(من القارئ)

#### Group Members:
- Mohammed Alrajeh
- Faris Alshammari
- Suliman Alsadan

#### Objectives:
Our objective is to develop a model capable of accurately identifying the name of the reciter of a given Quranic recitation.

#### Dataset Description:
Our dataset will comprise various audio recordings of Quranic recitations performed by different reciters in diverse environments, which our team will collect to simulate real-life scenarios. We aim to avoid relying on studio-recorded recitations from the internet, as they may not reflect the diversity of acoustic conditions encountered in practice.

#### Dataset Link:
N/A

#### The expected (Machine learning / Deep Learning) Algorithms:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): These networks are commonly used for analyzing and classifying image and audio data.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs): These networks are useful for analyzing sequential data such as audio, as they can capture temporal dependencies.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Networks: These are a specific type of RNN that can remember past events for a longer duration, which could be useful for analyzing longer audio recordings.

#### Final Deliverables:
- README.md file.
