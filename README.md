# Capstone Proposal


### Please edit this README.md file based on your Capstone project idea.

#### Project Title:
First idea Title is 'MiQiyas'.

#### Project Title:
Second idea Title is 'Sign'. <== we will reconsider the name

#### Group Members:
- Alaa 
- Amjad 
- Shatha 

#### Objectives 1st idea:
MiQiyas will allow high school student to predict whether their dream college will accept them or not based on their grades,
we need to grant access to Ministry of education data to train our model.

#### Objectives 2nd idea:
Sign will be used at Hajj and Umrah to help the worker there to communicate with people who suffer from hear loss and cannot read Arabic,
so in order to achive this we need first to translate arabic to needed languge and then show the animation with sign language linked to it,
in case of arabic Language translation step will be skipped.
we need to collect sign language 'we need to search more' to build and train our model.
