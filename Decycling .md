## Overviwe 
A garbage detection system is a type of computer vision system designed to automatically detect and classify different types of garbage. The system uses advanced image processing algorithms and deep learning models to analyze images of garbage and classify them based on their type.

To classify garbage, the system typically uses a combination of visual and contextual features. For example, the system might analyze the shape, size, color, and texture of different objects in the image to determine their type. It might also use contextual information such as the location, time, and other environmental factors to improve the accuracy of its classification.
Some common types of garbage that a detection system might be able to classify include plastic, paper, metal, glass, organic waste, and hazardous materials. The system might also be able to identify specific items such as bottles, cans, food waste, and electronic devices.

## Objectives
 The primary objective of the proposal is to develop a garbage detection system that can accurately identify different types of garbage such as plastic, paper, and food waste. The system should be able to operate in different environmental conditions and lighting conditions to ensure maximum accuracy.
- Enhance waste sorting efficiency: The system should be capable of sorting garbage accurately and efficiently, so that the waste can be sorted and processed appropriately. This would reduce the risk of contamination and improve the recycling process.
- Reduce human involvement: By implementing a garbage detection system, the need for manual sorting and handling of waste will be reduced, which can help reduce the risk of occupational hazards for workers and ensure faster and more efficient processing of waste.
- Promote environmental sustainability: The implementation of a garbage detection system will contribute to promoting environmental sustainability by reducing waste contamination and promoting the recycling process.
- Improve public health: Proper waste management is essential for maintaining public health. The garbage detection system would help prevent the accumulation of garbage in public areas, thus reducing the risk of diseases and other health hazards.
